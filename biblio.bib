abstract = {Summary In work on Martha's Vineyard, William Labov developed methodological innovations that allowed linguists to track the progress of linguistic changes and established the basis for a synchronic approach to language change. Perhaps the most important innovation was the apparent-time construct, a surrogate for the real-time examination of data at different points in history. Over the last 30 years linguists have used the apparent-time construct in many situations to make inferences about ongoing changes. Researchers desiring to use real-time evidence for studying language change have two options: (i) comparison of evidence from a new study to some pre-existing data, or (ii) re-survey of a community or a group of informants after a time-lapse. Researchers should be careful when making assumptions based on apparent-time data from adolescents and teenagers, and they must be alert both to the possible effects of sociolectal adjustments and to age-grading with adult cohorts.}

 abstract = {The large linguistic area of the Vaupes River region in northwest Amazonia is characterized by obligatory multilingualism based on two principles of strict exogamy: "My brothers are those who share a language with me" and "We don't marry our sisters." Tariana is the only North Arawak language spoken in the Vaupes region. East Tucanoan languages spoken there are closely related and display a significant degree of structural similarity, as well as a strong inhibition against the "language-mixing" of lexical loans. This paper considers areal influences of East Tucanoan on Tariana phonology, grammatical structure, and semantics. It also discusses independent innovations in Tariana, in contrast to other North Arawak languages of the upper Rio Negro region, and language attrition phenomena. This investigation contributes both to the study of North Arawak languages of South America and to our understanding of areal diffusion of structural patterns in a relatively young linguistic area.},

abstract = "This paper investigates the accuracy of recall data by comparing administrative records with retrospective, self-reported survey responses to income and asset questions for a sample of self-employed households from coastal India. It finds that the magnitude of the recall error increases over time, in part because respondents resort to inference rather than memory. Monthly earnings that are higher than the median are also better recalled. These results have implications for the accuracy of the moments of the self-reported earnings distribution. It also finds that income earners are more accurate than their wives. In addition, the use of time cues can worsen accuracy if they are not relevant to the respondent, and the position of the recall questions in the two-hour long survey does not affect accuracy."
